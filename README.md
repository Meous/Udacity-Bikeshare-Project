### Exploring Udacity Bikeshare Dataset


### Description
This program makes use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This python program imports the aforementioned data and answers some interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. In addition, this program takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
